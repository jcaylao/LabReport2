First *handleRequest* is called, the relevant arguments of handleRequest is a url of type URI. *Parameters* is a string array that contains strings of the url. The value of the variable *word* gets assigned to empty at first and then once I input the add request *word* is reassigned to the string *"Hi"*. *wordList* starts off as an empty arraylist, after I inputted the add request it contains 1 element which is the string *"Hi"*.

Then *printStrings* method is called, the relevant arguments of printStrings is an arraylist of type String. The stringBuilder *result* starts off as empty then elements of list are appended.

The value of the variable *word* is *"Hi"* and then once I input the add request *word* is reassigned to the string *"my name is jaira"*. *wordList* contains only 1 element which is the string *"Hi"*, then *"my name is jaira"* is added which results in wordList containing 2 elements.

# **Part 2**

**A failure-inducing input for the buggy program**
```
  @Test
  public void testReverseInPlaceFail() {
    int[] input2 = {8,9,10};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input2);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{10,9,8}, input2);
  }
 ```
 
 **An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure**
 ```
 	@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 555 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 555 }, input1);
	}
```

**The symptom, as the output of running the tests**

# **Part 3**

In lab of week 2, I learned how to download code from my repository and uploade changes using Github Desktop. This class is my first time getting introduced to github and so this was also my first time getting introduced to Github desktop. Although this was my first time, the lab write-up made this process easy because it was really easy to follow along through the steps given. This process also included learning how to commit and push the changes I made in order for it to appear on Github. Learning this was really useful because I have used this method of downloading code and cloning repositories through Github Desktop multiple times in some of the future labs.
